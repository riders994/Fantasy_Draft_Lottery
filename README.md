# Fantasy Draft Lottery and Average Draft Position Scripts

These are simple scripts that I find useful for my fantasy league. One is used to calculate average draft position to test out different odds rollouts. The other is the script I use to actually run my fantasy basketball league, and post the results directly to facebook.

Currently both scripts are run just by using the `python <file>` command. More will be added later.
