# Fantasy Draft Lottery and Average Draft Position Scripts

I am in the process of classing these scripts. Updates will be made periodically as WojBot is updated.

These scripts are to simulate the NBA draft lottery for my fantasy league. I also have an ADP tester to see how different odds rollouts tend to go.

This will soon be integrated fully into WojBot, but will always be usable by anyone as standalone scripts. The goal is for anyone to be able to use these, even though they probably won't want to.

TODO: Class up the ADP test
TODO: Add debugging options to draftorder
TODO: Add user input options to adp_test
